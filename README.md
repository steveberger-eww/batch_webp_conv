## To Do's ( for me )

- getting axios to work with `server.js`

- getting the fileupload.tsx to freaking work

- do some more styling

maybe ( -> add account creation / login / user dashboard )

- figure out what the hell this here means `Argument of type 'ArrayBuffer' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Buffer'.
Type 'ArrayBuffer' is missing the following properties from type 'Buffer': write, toJSON, equals, compare, and 99 more.`

## Libs used for this one here

- [Axios](https://axios-http.com)
- [React Dropzone](https://react-dropzone.js.org)
- [Sharp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sharp)
- could be i have forgotten something, i'm going to add that later

## See ya!
